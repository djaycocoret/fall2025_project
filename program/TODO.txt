Refactor the program such that the game header takes all the other headers and combines.

The main.cpp should have a small set up.

Issue is that the design philosophy of the program was made, with the assumption that the grid could update the agents (enemies/towers) sequentially. Yet the assignment requests one to make it turn based.

The grid object should have as an attribute a vector containing pointers to owners.

The owners should have as an attribute a vector containing pointer to agents.

The agents should have some information on the owners.
